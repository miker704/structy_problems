# safe cracking
# Oh-no! You forgot the number combination that unlocks your safe.
#  Luckily, you knew that you'd be forgetful so you previously wrote
#   down a bunch of hints that can be used to determine the correct combination. Each hint is a pair
#   of numbers "x, y" that indicates you must enter digit "x" before "y" (but not necessarily immediately before y).

# The keypad on the safe has digits 0-9. You can assume that the hints
#  will generate exactly one working combination and that a digit can occur zero or one time in the answer.

# Write a function, safeCracking, that takes in an array of hints as
#  an argument and determines the combination that will unlock the safe.
#  The function should return a string representing the combination.
