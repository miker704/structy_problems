# overlap subsequence
# Write a function, overlapSubsequence, that takes in two strings as arguments.
#  The function should return the length of the longest overlapping subsequence.

# A subsequence of a string can be created by deleting any characters of the string,
#  while maintaining the relative order of characters.
