# tribonacci
# Write a function tribonacci that takes in a number argument, n,
# and returns the n-th number of the Tribonacci sequence.

# The 0-th and 1-st numbers of the sequence are both 0.

# The 2-nd number of the sequence is 1.

# To generate further numbers of the sequence, calculate the sum of previous three numbers.

# Solve this recursively.

def tribonacci(n, haSh={}):

print(tribonacci(0))  # 0
print(tribonacci(1))  # 0
print(tribonacci(2))  # 1
