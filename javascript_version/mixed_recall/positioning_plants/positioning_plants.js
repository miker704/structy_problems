// positioning plants
// You've been hired to plant flowers in a garden with n different positions.
// There are m different flower types.
//  The prices of flowers types vary depending on which position they are planted. Your 
//  bosses are picky, they tell you to never plant two of the same flower type right next to each other. 
//  What is the minimum cost we need to plant a flower in each position of the garden?

// Write a function, positioningPlants, that takes in a 2D array with dimensions n * m. 
// Each row of the array represents the costs of the flower types at that position. 
// This means that costs[i][j] represents the cost of planting flower type j at position i. 
// For example:

// Given these costs,

// costs = [
//   [4, 3, 7],
//   [6, 1, 9],
//   [2, 5, 3]
// ]

// The costs of plants at position 1 are $6, $1, and $9.
// The cost of planting flower type 0 at position 1 is $6.
// The cost of planting flower type 2 at position 1 is $9.
// The function should return the minimum cost of planting flowers without placing 
// the same flower type in adjacent positions.

const positioningPlants = (costs) => {

};
