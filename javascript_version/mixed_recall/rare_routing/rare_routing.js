// rare routing
// Write a function, rareRouting, that takes in a number of cities (n) 
// and a two dimensional 
// array where each subarray represents a direct road that connects a pair of cities.
//  The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not there exists a unique
//   route for every pair of cities. A route is a sequence of roads that does not
//    visit a city more than once.

// Cities will be numbered 0 to n - 1.

// You can assume that all roads are two-way roads. This means if there is a road between A and B, 
// then you can use that road to go from A to B or go from B to A.

// For example, given these roads:

// 0 --- 1
// | \
// |  \
// |   \
// 2    3

// There is a unique route for between every pair of cities.
// So the answer is true.


// For example, given these roads:

// 0 --- 1
// | \
// |  \
// |   \
// 2 -- 3

// There are two routes that can be used to travel from city 1 to city 2:
// - first route:  1, 0, 2
// - second route: 1, 0, 3, 2 
// The answer is false, because routes should be unique.
